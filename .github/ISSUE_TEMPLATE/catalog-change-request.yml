        Thank you for contributing to the [Dynamics 365 business process catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/guidance/business-processes/)! Registering your request here is the first step in contributing. Your request will be reviewed and approved. Not all request may be approved. Approved requests will be added to the business process catalog. Find the catalog and templates at [https://github.com/microsoft/dynamics365patternspractices/templates/business-processes](https://github.com/microsoft/dynamics365patternspractices/tree/main/templates/business-processes). If you want to contribute with architectural patterns for Dynamics 365 implementations, use the templates at [https://github.com/microsoft/dynamics365patternspractices/templates/architecture](https://github.com/microsoft/dynamics365patternspractices/tree/main/templates/architecture). We do not recommend starting work on a new article for a new business process catalog row until the catalog request is approved. You can use this request to add new business processes or new patterns and practices to the catalog. Use one issue request for each new row you want to add or update.
