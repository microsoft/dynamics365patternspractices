# Dynamics 365 Patterns and Practices graphics

This folder contains source files for the diagrams in the [business process guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/guidance/business-processes/about) in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 guidance hub. Microsoft uploads new versions of the files with each update of the business process catalog. We always recommend that you download the latest version each time you start a new project. 

The graphics are created in Visio based on the data in the associated Excel workbook.  Each end-to-end process includes one Visio file. The graphics inside each file are listed by [catalog ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/guidance/business-processes/about#catalog-ids). We recommend that you download the graphics to help accelerate the deployment of your fit-gap anaylsis process and to understand how the process works by default with Dynamics 365 applications out of the box. Keep in mind that not all variations of business processes may be documented in a given diagram. You can easily customize the graphics for your business requirements by modifying the arrows, adding steps, or removing steps as required.
